## 🧬 Colorectal Cancer Patient Survival Prediction
📄 Project Introduction (MLOps Project - 5)
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for predicting colorectal cancer patient survival, implemented using modern MLOps tools and principles.

## ✨ Highlights of the Project
📦 Use of MLflow with DagsHub for experiment tracking and model management

☸️ Kubernetes cluster setup on a local PC (using Minikube)

🛠️ Model training via Kubeflow Pipelines

🐳 DockerHub integration for containerized application management



## 🧩 Use Cases
Predicting patient survival outcomes based on medical and demographic data
